## Design Decisions

- Built with **Laravel 12**
- Styling with **Tailwind CSS**
- Asset management with **Vite**
- Uses **Eloquent relationships** to associate `ServiceProvider` with `Category`

## Performance Optimizations

- **Image Optimization**: Images are lazy loaded
- **Database Queries**: Eager loading is used for the `category` relationship in the service provider index method to avoid N+1 queries
- **TTFB (Time to First Byte)**: Minimized the critical CSS and JavaScript, defer JS loading and lazy load images 
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: Minimized critical CSS and inlined the essential CSS required for the first render

### Areas for future enhancementÂ 
- **Pagination**: Add pagination to the service provider list when dealing with a large number of records
- **Image upload & optimization**: Implement image upload functionality with thumbnail to improve performance
- **CRUD for service providers**: Add store, update and delete methods for service providers instead of using factories
- **Category CRUD**: Add full CRUD functionality for `Category` instead of using seeders
- **Test coverage**: Implement tests for all functionalities
- **Telescope**: Enable in non-local environments if needed for broader monitoring
